# navhero

A simple experiment to give nav1.0 super powers.

Named routing in Nav 1.0 could get messy, with large router files here and there.

This project aims at experimenting with the navigator.

Router is a list of sub router with each subrouter having its own route.

Features grouped folder by folder can have their own router and registered in the main router.
